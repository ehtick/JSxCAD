# Terrarium

This is a simple terrarium design intended to be cut from transparent acrylic.

* The terrarium forms a box with the corners removed, allowing for excess water drainage.
* A hole is provided in the top to allow the top panel to be removed or water to be added.
* A lid is provided for the hole to minimize moisture loss.

This terrarium was designed for growing moss, but might be useful for other kinds of plants as well.
