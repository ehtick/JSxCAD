# Creating Geometry
One of the core functions of JSxCAD is creating geometry and a number of primitives and helper functions are provided to make creating new geometry easier. Generally geometry primitives are provided in the form thing(x axis diameter, y axis diameter, z axis height) where the second two are optional.
