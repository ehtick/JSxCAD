md`# Reference Geometry`;
md`Each shape in jot has it's own frame of reference which can be accessed. A shapes internal frame of reference can be used to position a new shape relative to an existing shape. A shapes frame of reference can be redefined by defining it as an item`;

const a = Box(10, 10, 1).color('red').x(10);

const b = Box(5, 5, 2).color('blue').y(10);

Group(a, b).view();

### Align
Returns a point relative to a shape which can be used for positioning other shapes. Behavior needs to be updated to function this way.
`;

Group(a, b, b.to(a.align('<x'))).view();

### At
Performes an operation on a shape at a particular location.
`;

Group(b, a.at(b, cut(b))).view(); //Moves a to b, makes the cut, then moves a back to it's original location

//Group(a, b.at(a, clip(a)).view();

md`

### By
Moves a shape from it's current location by a reference amount.
`;

Group(a, b.by(a)).view(); //Moves the blue square in the X direction the same amount that the red square had been moved

md`
---
### To
Moves a shape to a reference position.
`;

Group(a, b.to(a)).view(); //Moves the blue square to the red square
