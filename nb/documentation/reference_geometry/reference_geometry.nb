md`Each shape in jot has it's own frame of reference which can be accessed. A shapes internal frame of reference can be used to position a new shape relative to an existing shape. A shapes frame of reference can be redefined by defining it as an item`;

### Align
Returns a point relative to a shape which can be used for positioning other shapes
`;

### At
Places a shape at a reference point.

### By
Moves a shape from it's current location by a reference amount.
`;

Group(a, b.by(a)).view(); //Moves the blue square in the X direction the same amount that the red square had been moved

### To
Moves a shape to a reference position.
